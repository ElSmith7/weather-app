# Weather App

A weather app which displays a five-day weather forecast for a specific location.

## About the project

This app takes weather data from [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/) and displays the forecast to the user, as well as the current weather conditions. The app can either give you the weather from the user's location - but only if given permission to access it with the Geolocation API - or it can return the results from a searched city.

I built this application to develop my Javascript skills and to have a base app which I could then [re-create using react](https://github.com/ElSmith7/react-weather).

## Built with

- JavaScript
- HTML
- css3
- Bootstrap

## Conclusion

While the app is perfectly functionalI would have liked to add in a celcius to farenheit converter however I ended up doing this with my [React version of the app](https://github.com/ElSmith7/react-weather) as the component structure allowed for an easier flow of data across the current weather and forecast components.

Overall this was great practice in writing Javascript and really enjoyable to experiment with building dynamic css features - such as the night mode.
